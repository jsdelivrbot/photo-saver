Photo Saver
====================

This project was created to practice my use of react and create a place for a user to save their favorite photos they find on the internet as well as star their favorite photos and view those separately, any photo added is able to be deleted as well. To run the application, after cloning the repo just run npm start and go to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser.
